# The expected format is:
# original token(tab)replacement token[,replacement token]...
#
# e.g.
# brit pop	britpop
# rnb    rhythm and blues, r&b
# Indie Pop	Indie, Indie Pop
#
# Duplicate tags are automatically dealt with. The original token is not case 
# sensitive, but case is preserved for the replacement value(s).
# 
# If you want to block a tag, specify its replacement as '-NONE-'. The tag will
# then be removed from the tagstream. 


# The following values were chosen based almost entirely on subjective personal preference and based
# on what came up fetching tags from my library. I make no attempt at defending the choices, so please 
# feel free to edit this to suit your own tastes. I generally chose the name-form Wikipedia treated as 
# canonical. If there's a better, non-subjective choice for these (or additions), please let me know.
