    This method performs an inplace multi-field sort on the provided list of tag tuples, using the integer weights

    3 item tuples, the result will be sorted first by the values in position 1 and then, where position 1 values are the same, 
    by the values in position 2. Sort order is descending and this sort should be stable. Although the sort is inplace, we 
    return a reference to the original (now sorted) list, as a convenience.
